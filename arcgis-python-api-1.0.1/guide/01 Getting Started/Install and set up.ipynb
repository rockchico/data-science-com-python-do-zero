    "# Install using Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "The ArcGIS API for Python is distributed via conda. [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/get-started.html) is a popular package and environment manager application that helps you install and update packages such as the ArcGIS Python API and their dependencies. You can install the API through two main workflows - install through anaconda or install using ArcGIS Pro. Both are outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step: 1 Get Conda\n",
    "Install the latest version of [Anaconda for Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (for Python 3.5), if you don't already have conda. The ArcGIS API for Python requires Python 3.\n",
    "If you have installed ArcGIS Pro 1.3 or later, you already have conda and you can skip to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step: 2 Install `arcgis` package\n",
    "To download and install the API in your conda environment, type the following command in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c esri arcgis\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running a Windows OS, you can type this into your command prompt or PowerShell. If you are running a Mac or Linux OS, you can type this into your terminal application. In the screen shot below, I am typing this command into the Windows command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "![install arcgis package](http://esri.github.io/arcgis-python-api/notebooks/nbimages/guide_getstarted_InstallAndSetup_01.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install using ArcGIS Pro\n",
    "ArcGIS Pro 1.4 and later gives you a **Python Package Manager** interface that can be used to download and install the ArcGIS API for Python. As shown in the screen shot below, from your Pro backstage, click on the 'Python' tab. Then click on 'Add Packages' button and type `arcgis` into the search bar. You may have to click on the 'refresh' button to ensure you are getting the latest version of the package. Then click 'Install' and accept the terms and conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![install using ArcGIS Pro](http://esri.github.io/arcgis-python-api/notebooks/nbimages/guide_getstarted_InstallAndSetup_03.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have installed ArcGIS Pro 1.3, then you can use the **Python Command Prompt** shortcut within the ArcGIS Pro program group in Windows start menu and type the conda install command explained earlier. Depending on how you installed Pro, you might have to start this prompt with elevated privileges.    \n",
    "\n",
    "You can now start using the API in your Python IDE of choice, or from the Jupyter Notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upgrade from older arcgis package\n",
    "If you are upgrading from an older version of arcgis package, run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda upgrade -c esri arcgis\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using ArcGIS Pro 1.4 or later to install the API, then as you guessed, you can use the **Update Packages** tab in the screen shot above to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "### Offline install\n",
    "If you would like to install the API on a machine without internet or, if your workstation is in a disconnected network, you can do so in three steps. \n",
    " * First, install the latest version of [Anaconda for Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (for Python 3.5). It is preferable you install full anaconda and not miniconda. \n",
    " * Next download the latest version of the API from [Esri's channel on anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/Esri/arcgis/files) for your OS. For instance, if you are installing on Linux 64-bit, then download the package titled `linux-64/arcgis-1.0.1-py35_1.tar.bz2` into a known location.\n",
    " * Run conda from your terminal and install the API using the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "    `conda install /path_to_package_download_folder/linux-64/arcgis-1.0.1-py35_1.tar.bz2`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find yourself installing the API in multiple machines or, if you need to use miniconda in your workflow, it might be beneficial to set up an offline conda channel. Refer to the [Esri Knowledge Base article for instructions](http://support.esri.com/Products/Developers/scripting-and-automation/arcgis-python-api/1-0#knowledge-base).\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "## Start jupyter notebook\n",
    "To use the API in the Jupyter Notebook environment, use the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to this doc for more help on [how to use the notebook environment](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/using-the-jupyter-notebook-environment/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test your install\n",
    "From the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, create a new Python 3 notebook and type these lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from arcgis.gis import GIS\n",
    "    my_gis = GIS()\n",
    "    my_gis.map()\n",
    "    \n",
    "If the installation went through fine, you should see a map come up as shown below:\n",
