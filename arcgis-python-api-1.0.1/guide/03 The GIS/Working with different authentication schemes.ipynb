    "# Working with different authentication schemes\n",
    "\n",

    "* built-in users\n",
    "* users using LDAP, via \n",
    " * Basic authentication \n",
    " * Portal tier authentication\n",
    "* users using Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) through NTLM or Kerberos\n",
    "* smart card users / PKI authentication using certificate and key files\n",
    "* users connected to an ArcGIS Enterprise instance using ArcGIS Pro\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GIS` class supports constructing a `GIS` object given a url and user credentials to ArcGIS Online or an ArcGIS Enterprise instance. User credentials can be passed in using username/password pair, or key_file/cert_file pair (in case of PKI). Supports built-in users, LDAP, PKI and anonymous access.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no url is provided, ArcGIS Online is used. If username/password or key/cert files are not provided, anonymous access is used. Additionally, the script can leverage the ArcGIS Pro app to login to the portal and their scripts can use whichever Portal is currently active.\n",
